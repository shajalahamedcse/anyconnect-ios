## Problem Statement

### Task 1 :

 Setup a standalone  master OR a slave build machine for Jenkins to build iOS project.  
  
* Configure Jenkins on a single/local machine. Add a build job to build and package for the provided iOS project.  
  
* Assume that there is already a Jenkins server. Configure the slave build machine so that it can be added as the host system for the iOS project build environment.  
  
For either case, configure build environment write required scripts to execute the build.  
  
Successful completion of the task should build the iOS project successfully on demand.  

### Task 2 :  
 Integrate a test framework to test the output generated by the task 1. The provided source has a single button, so able to demonstrate the test would be plus.  
  
  
* For Xcode code signing using a test Apple account.  
* Have documentation as required to explain a particular task.  
Task 1 and 2 should follow the continuous integration system process (excluding the part of source repo and triggering the build).
